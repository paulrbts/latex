# LaTeX
A repo for my LaTeX files and tools.

## Contents
* [myapalike-url](https://github.com/paulrbts/latex/tree/master/texmf/bibtex/bst) is a modified version of apalike.bst which is distributed with MacTex.
It is updated to better fit the requirements of Staffordshire University's citation style, following the Harvard format, and to incorporate URLs.
* [latex](https://github.com/paulrbts/latex/tree/master/texmf/tex/latex) contains various .sty and .clo files that I've gathered over the years.
